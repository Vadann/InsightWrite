# Insight Write Journaling Application

Welcome! The team and I collaborated to create **Insight Write** üìí, a Django web application built with Python.

Our website is designed to offer a unique journaling experience, serving individuals interested in personal growth and self-expression. **Insight Write** provides a private and supportive space for users to reflect and improve their mental health.
